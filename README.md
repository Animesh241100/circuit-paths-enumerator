# Circuit to Graph

## Overview of the Project
* This is a python script which reads and parses a verilog file as input
* Then it creates a directed acyclic graph(DAG) to represent the equivalent combinational circuit.
* We use python dictionaries to represent the DAG in the form of an Adjacency list.

## Execution method:
* Run this command
    python3 enumerator.py
* A prompt opens, enter the details
    Enter a valid verilog file name:            

**PS:** *The script is still in making. Later this will allow the user to decide which verilog file to take in as input*
